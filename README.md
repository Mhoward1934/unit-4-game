# unit-4-game
This is the fourth assignment for the SMU Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we were required to create a fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.
## Getting Started

### Crystal Collector
**Instructions:**
Your mission is to match the Crystals Value generated at the start of the game. There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your score. You win the game by matching your score to the Crystals Value, you lose the game if your score goes above the Crystals Value. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
